# JS-Python

This program is aimed to detect people's moods based on what they tell the program. Once the program detects the user's mood, it generates appropriate messages. There is a chatbot specifically made for the "negative" sentiment, aiming to comfort the user and provide some advice. The sentiment analyzer cannot always detect the user's mood accurately, but it does a decent job.
